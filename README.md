Dynamic Programming contest problems

Problem 1 - Cable Cutting

We have a cable of length N, which can be cut in up to N pieces. Each piece is of integral length.
We also have a table of values for a cable of length k (for k from 1 to N).
We would like to calculate the maximum value we can get from the given cable.

Problem 2 - String transform

We have a starting string s1 and a target string s2 and we would like to transform s1 to s2.
The available moves are:
delete  - Delete a character from s1 (cost 1)
insert  - Insert a character in s1 (cost 1)
match   - Match a character in s1 with one in s2 (cost 0)
replace - Replace a character in s1 with another (cost 1)

Our goal to make s2 from s1 with the least possible cost.

Problem 3 - Mosaic

We have an NxM board and square tiles whose sides are a power of two (1x1, 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, ...).
We would like to fill the board with the least amount of tiles possible.


Problem 4- Huffman Encoding

Implement the Huffman encoding algorithm and calculate the compression ratio.

Problem 5 - Simple Page Rank

Implementation of Google's Page Rank algorithm (simpler version).
